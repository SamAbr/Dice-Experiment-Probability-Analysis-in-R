# 🎲 Dice Experiment Probability Analysis 🎲

## Overview
Welcome to the **Dice Probability Distribution Analysis** project! Ever wondered about the fascinating probabilities behind rolling two dice? In this project, we delve into the world of dice and analyze various random variables like:
- 🔢 The **Sum** of the two dice
- 🎯 The **Maximum** face value rolled
- ➖ The **Absolute Difference** between the dice
- ✖️ The **Product** of the two dice

This project uses **R programming** to explore the entire sample space of two dice rolls, revealing interesting insights and statistical distributions.

## 🔍 Key Features
- 🚀 **Comprehensive Sample Space**: Generates every possible outcome of two dice rolls.
- 📊 **Probability Distributions**: Calculate probabilities for random variables including sum, maximum, difference, and product.
- 🧮 **Statistical Analysis in R**: Perform in-depth analysis using R with clean and efficient code.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/dice-probability-distribution.git
2. Ensure you have **R** installed. You can download it [here](https://www.r-project.org/).
3. Install the required R packages:
   ```r
   install.packages("dplyr")
   ```

### Usage
1. Open the `dice_probability_analysis.R` file in RStudio or any R environment.
2. Run the script to generate the dice sample space and calculate the probabilities for various random variables.

Once executed, you'll see the magic of probability unfold as the script analyzes dice rolls and provides insights into their distributions!

## 📊 Example Output
- **Sample Space**: All combinations of two dice rolls (36 outcomes).
- **Probability Distributions**: Graphs and tables showcasing the probabilities for each random variable.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **R programming**: For statistical computation and probability distribution analysis.
- **dplyr**: A powerful package for data manipulation in R.
