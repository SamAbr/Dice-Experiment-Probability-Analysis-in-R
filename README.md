# Dice-Experiment-Probability-Analysis-in-R
This project analyzes the probability distributions from rolling two dice. It focuses on random variables such as the sum, maximum, absolute difference, and product of the dice rolls. Using R, the sample space is generated, and key probabilities are calculated to illustrate basic statistical concepts.
